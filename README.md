# Description

This repo is my personal (@zanloy) repo for dotfiles. It's pretty specialized
to my tastes but feel free to take parts of my various application configs.

Or go all out and just install the whole thing with this command:

```
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zanloy/dotfiles/master/install.sh`"
```
